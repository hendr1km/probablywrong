    "text": "What we have missed\nIn a PRP we plot the residuals or error of our Regression model against one or more independant variables. This allows us a couple of things - starting with the first one: discovering non randomness in the residuals. Why is non randomness an issue? When doing a Regression, we assume that we have got some error as jitter around our predictions that does not contain any remaining trend. This error is caused by all that stuff we do not know about our independent variable and can not model. Theory assumes, that if we had all the variables in the iniverse with a causal relationship to our independent variable , we could make predictions without any error. However this is fictional and error is part of our complex reality, that we can only approxiamte using such a naive linear representation of the world. It is only a problem if our error is not random, because then there is some sort of trend or pattern left in the data that we could have modeled with our variables. In practice this can appear if there is some sort of non linear trend in our data or interactions of variables, that we need to include in our model.\nIn the following example we will start by visualising the residuals from our regression using broom and ggplot by plotting those against one of our independent variable used in the model.\nThrough the use of geom_smoothregression lines we can spot remaining trends in our residuals. The blue regression line is our helper tool to spot those. Keep in mind that we want to have a intercept and slope of approximaetly zero - this means there is no trend left. The red line represents the predictions of our model. In the standard broom::augment() output those are scaled to 0 when plotting our residuals.\nIn the following plot you can see that both lines are approximately on the same slope, indicating that we did not spot any remaining trends in the residual that our model did not catch. At least regarding the variable x3.\n\nm0 &lt;- lm(y0 ~ x1 + x2 + x3)\n\nm0 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;% \n  mutate(x3 = dvmisc::quant_groups(x3, 3)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(x1,x2)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .resid))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = value, y = 0), method = \"lm\", color = \"red\")+\n  facet_grid(vars(name), vars(x3))\n\n\n\n\nIn the second plot our blue regression lines indicate that there is still some pattern left in our variable x2 that is not included in our model. This is caused by a quadatric relationship that still remains in our residualds. This is a sign that we should adjust our model.\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(y_ac ~ x1 + x2 + x3)\n\nm1 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = x2, y = .resid))+\n  xlim(c(50,190))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = x2, y = 0), method = \"lm\", color = \"red\")+\n  ylab(\"residuals of y_ac ~ x1 + x2 + x3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotting Interactions\nIn the plots above we only looked at one variable of our model. However we do have multiple variables in our model and we might be interested in looking at them all. One way of doing this is pivoting the data into a long format and visualising those in a grid. Now we can spot non linear trends all of our predictor variables. In the following plot we can see that the residuals for x1 and x3 do not contain any unmodelled information, while the residualds for x2 does.\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(y_ac ~ x1 + x2 + x3)\n\nm1 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(c(x1, x2, x3)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .resid))+\n  xlim(c(50,190))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = value, y = 0), method = \"lm\", color = \"red\")+\n  facet_grid(vars(name))\n\n\n\n\nHowever in this can we only plotted our predictor variables against the residuals of our model and thus our response variable. To spot how our predictor variables relate to each other we might want to plot those against echt other as well. One way of doing this is plotting those as binned into quantiles in our grid. We can do this using the function dvmisc::quant_groups() and sort the values of x3 into 3 bins based on our quantiles.\nThis allows us to spot interactions between our variables x3 and and x1 or x2 that are not in our model. In this plot you can see that the relationship between x1 and y changes at different qunatiles of x3. For lower values of x3 there is a negative relationship between x1 and x3, while the relationship gets more positive with higher values. We can see that our model currently does not account for this interaction.\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2 + x3)\n\nm1 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;% \n  mutate(x3 = dvmisc::quant_groups(x3, 3)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(x1,x2)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .resid))+\n  xlim(c(50,190))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = value, y = 0), method = \"lm\", color = \"red\")+\n  facet_grid(vars(name), vars(x3))\n\n\n\n\nThis method can also be used to spot three way interactions. If we already included a two way interaction and still see a change in the relationship of one variable there might be a additional interaction. In the following example we plotted x1 in our bins and thus can see how x2 and x3 vary for different quantiles of x1. We can see that there is no real trend left in the residuals when looking at x2 - we already included the interaction for x2 and x1. For x3 we can see that there is some pattern left and this trend in the residuals varys across x1.\n\nset.seed(123)\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(800, 50, 20)\nx2 &lt;- rnorm(800, 80, 40)\nx3 &lt;- rnorm(800, 90, 50)\nerror &lt;- rnorm(800, 0, 500)\ny1 &lt;- 300 - (0.2 * x1) + (0.2 * x2) + (0.2 * x1 * x2* x3) + error\n\nm3 &lt;- lm(y1 ~ x1 * x2 + x3)\n\nsummary(m3)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y1 ~ x1 * x2 + x3)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-131705   -9143     270   10496  134970 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This allows us to plot our predicted slopes for the two way interaction the thus the effects of the third variables on that slopes. In other words we can interpret how our two way interaction varies across our third variable e.g. x1 and x2 vary across x3.\n\nm3 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;%\n  mutate(.resid = .fitted + .resid) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x3 = dvmisc::quant_groups(x3, 2)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x3 = paste(\"x3\", x3)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x2 = dvmisc::quant_groups(x2, 2)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x2 = paste(\"x2\", x2)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = .resid))+\n  # geom_smooth(aes(x = .fitted))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = x1, y = .resid), method = \"lm\")+\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = x1, y = .fitted), col = \"red\", method = \"lm\")+\n  facet_grid(vars(x2), vars(x3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond reversed engeneering\nIn all of our plots so far we displayed the residuals of our model against a variables that is itself already a independent variable in the model. However we do not need to. This allows us plot a variable against our response variable while controlling for another variable.\nFor example we might be interested in including x1 into the model. Thus we only want plot x1 against y, while controlling for x2. In comparison to added variable plots, subtracting out the predictor variable and fitting a visual regression to those residuals is not only a approximation of the regression slope, but rather a accurate estimation. By using the same methods we used above, e.g. binning the other variable x2 we can also spot interactions before even fitting x1 into the model.\n\ny_av &lt;- 300 - (0.2 * x1) + (0.2 * x3) + (0.2 * x2) + (0.2 * x1 * x2) + error\n\nm4 &lt;- lm(y_av ~ x1 + x2 + x3)\n\nm4 %&gt;%\n  broom::augment() %&gt;% \n  mutate(.resid = .resid + m0$coef[[\"x1\"]] * x1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x2 = dvmisc::quant_groups(x2, 3)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = .resid))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(x2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional notes\nThat were a lot of scatter plots. Keep in mind that it can be helpful to scale and center your variables for plotting.\n\n\nLiterature\nFife, D. (2021, May 17).

Maybe you are already familiar with added variable plots, where we calcualte a seperate regression for y on x2 and then plot those residuals against x1. In a Regression Model the caclulation is however not done stepwise and thus the results that we obtain of this estimation is just an approximation. PRP allow us in comparison to added variable plots to do a accurate estiamation by subtracting out the variable from the model by multiplaying the coefficiant to each value of x1. This allows us to plot a specific variable of our regression model, while adjusting / controlling for others.

    "text": "Evaluating parameter estimates for different odds and weights\nWe can evaluate the performance of each model by looking at the median error at different values of our variable of interest - the mean of the two groups and the midpoint between these means. As you can see in the graph, at the critical value of 6.5, the median error tends to decrease up to a certain weight threshold, after which it increases again. So even in such a simple example, weights only help to a certain extent and must be used with caution.\n\n\nCode\npred &lt;- model_estimates %&gt;%\n  unnest(estimates) %&gt;%\n  group_by(odds, a_n, b_n, weight) %&gt;%\n  summarise(alpha.median = median(alpha),\n            beta.median = median(beta)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(x = list(c(5, 6.5, 8))) %&gt;%\n  unnest(x) %&gt;%\n  mutate(y = boot::inv.logit(alpha.median + beta.median * x))\n\nbench &lt;- pred %&gt;%\n  filter(weight == 1, odds == 1) %&gt;%\n  select(x, y_bench = y)\n\npred_bench &lt;- pred %&gt;%\n  left_join(bench, by = join_by(x)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_error = abs(y_bench - y)) \n\npred_min &lt;- pred_bench %&gt;%\n  filter(x == 6.5) %&gt;%\n  group_by(odds) %&gt;%\n  filter(median_error == min(median_error)) %&gt;%\n  select(odds, weight)\n\npred_bench %&gt;%\n  # mutate(odds = as.character(paste0(\"1:\",odds))) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = median_error, col = factor(x)))+\n  geom_line()+\n  facet_wrap(~odds)+\n  blog_theme()+\n  geom_vline(data = pred_min, aes(xintercept = weight), size = 1, color = \"gray\", linetype= \"dotted\")+\n  ylab(\"median error\")+\n  labs(col = \"value\")"

    "text": "Choosing weights\nThe threshold with the most balanced estimates seems to be closely related to the odds ratio. Thus, choosing the assumed imbalance of the odds as the weight may be the most appropriate, especially for smaller imbalances. At least in our simple setup. However, deviations for higher imbalances may also be due to the uncertainty of the estimates as the sample size for the minority group decreases. As the odds increase, almost any weight seems to produce more appropriate estimates than the unbalanced model where we did not adjust for sampling bias.\n\nno_weight_bench &lt;- pred_bench %&gt;%\n  filter(weight == 1) %&gt;%\n  select(odds, x, median_error_nw = median_error)\n\npred_nh &lt;- pred_bench %&gt;%\n  left_join(no_weight_bench, by = join_by(odds, x), relationship = \"many-to-many\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(improvement = ifelse(median_error &lt;= median_error_nw, TRUE, FALSE))\n\npred_min_error &lt;- pred_bench %&gt;%\n  group_by(x, odds) %&gt;%\n  filter(median_error == min(median_error)) %&gt;%\n  select(x, odds, weight) %&gt;%\n  mutate(best_weight = weight) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\npred_nh %&gt;%\n  left_join(pred_min_error, by = join_by(odds, weight, x)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = odds))+\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = improvement ), alpha = .5)+\n  geom_line(aes(x = odds, y = odds), linetype= \"dashed\")+\n  geom_point(aes(x = best_weight, y = odds))+\n  facet_wrap(~factor(x))+\n  blog_theme()+\n  labs(fill = \"improvement to\\nunbalanced model\")"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nDepending on the scenario, weights may be helpful to deal with sampling bias and class imbalance that does not reflect the population (at least in a simple setup, like the one we worked with). However, they should be used with prior knowledge of the population to not overadjust the sampling bias. One solution might be to adjust the observed odds by the expected odds ratio in the population, in the group affected by the sampling bias. The natural class imbalance should also be maintained in the logistic regression unless you have good reasons not to."

    "text": "To create a correlation network, we will use the BFI personality data from the {psych} package. First we will import all the necessary packages and set the font for our plot. We can import these from our system using extrafont. In the next step we will do a quick clean up of our data to include only the columns we want to visualise.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(extrafont) # font_import() to import your system fonts\n\nfont = \"Inclusive Sans\"\n\ndf &lt;- psych::bfi %&gt;%\n  tibble() %&gt;%\n  select(-c(age, education, gender))\n\nThe correlate() function from the {corrr} package allows us to define a specific correlation. However, we will use the Pearson correlation as the default setting. Next, we will switch to a long format using stretch() and only keep correlations higher than .2 or lower than -.2. This is something to play around with. Depending on how many variables you have in your data, your plot could get really messy if you include all the possible relationships between your variables.\n\ngraph_data &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    corrr::correlate() %&gt;% \n   corrr::stretch() %&gt;% \n    filter(abs(r) &gt; .2)\n\nThe last step is to build our visualisation. The font variable is the one we set above. In comparison to out of the box tools, this approach with {ggraph} and {igraph} allows us to adjust all the settings you are interested in, such as the size or colour of the nodes. We might also choose a different color scaling, for example if we only include postive correllations. In this specific example, I changed the background color to transparent.\n\ngraph_data %&gt;%\n    graph_from_data_frame(directed = FALSE) %&gt;%\n   ggraph(layout = \"kk\") +\n    geom_edge_link(aes(color = r, alpha = r), edge_width = 1) +\n    guides(edge_alpha = \"none\") +\n    scale_edge_colour_gradientn(limits = c(-1, 1), colors = c(\"firebrick2\", \"white\", \"dodgerblue2\")) +\n    geom_node_point(color = \"black\", size = 2) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), family = font, repel = TRUE) +\n    theme_graph(base_family = font, title_size = 10) +\n    theme(\n      plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n        text = element_text(family = font),\n        legend.title = element_text(family = font),\n        legend.text = element_text(family = font)\n    )"
