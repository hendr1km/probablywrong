These log odds can be transformed into probabilities, which then produce the characteristic S-curve.\nIn essence, it all comes down to odds. Having odds of 1:1 in our underlying data generation process means that both events are equally likely to occur, each with a probability of 50%. Our fictional population for the simulation follows this setup, with the probabilities of our events depending on values from normal distributions for both groups, with means of 5 and 8 and standard deviations of 1.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n    a &lt;- tibble(value = rnorm(4000, 5, 1), condition = \"a\")\n    b &lt;- tibble(value = rnorm(4000, 8, 1), condition = \"b\")\n    df_ab &lt;- bind_rows(a, b)\n\ndf_ab %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = condition, fill = condition))+\n  ggdist::stat_halfeye()+ \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,12,1))+\n  blog_theme()+\n  guides(fill = \"none\")"

    "text": "Conclusion\nDepending on the scenario, weights may be helpful to deal with sampling bias and class imbalance that does not reflect the population (at least in a simple setup, like the one we worked with). However, they should be used with prior knowledge of the population to not overadjust the sampling bias. One solution might be to adjust the observed odds by the expected odds ratio in the population, in the group affected by the sampling bias. The natural class imbalance should also be maintained in the logistic regression unless you have good reasons not to."
